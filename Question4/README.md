# README file of Question 4

## Question

Taking into account the studentâ€™s progress and goals, what is the best set of kanji / vocab to teach to them next?

## Strategy

1. Load the information about the frequently used Kanjis and difficulty levels from Question 1.
2. Compare them to try to determine the optimal learning sequence to follow to learn how to read a given source.
3. Given that they have completed some level of kanji from a learning sequence (such as "N5" or "Grade 6"), tell them what kanji to learn next.
