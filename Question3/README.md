# README file of Question 3

## Question

Kanjis have various information: number of strokes, difficulty levels, and strokes frequency of use in news, and WaniKani levels (assigned by WaniKani, a Japanese learning website). Pairing them together, do they have some interesting relationships?

## Strategy

This question was divided into two parts. Jimmy Wang did the first part: visualizations on Jisho data, while Xudong Guo focus on the second part: Jisho data with WaniKani levels.

In Jisho data, the following four questions are researched:

1. Number of strokes VS rank of frequency in news
2. Grades VS rank of frequency in news
3. Most frequently used 20 radicals VS rank of frequency in news
4. Difficulty Levels (Grade and JLPT level) VS number of Kanjis in that level

In Jisho VS WaniKani levels, following questions are reserached:

1. Number of kanjis in each WaniKani Level
2. Distribution of Frequency Rank in Each WaniKani Level
3. Distribution of Stroke Number in Each WaniKani Level
